## Introduction

Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## Business Task

Analyze subscription data to guide decisions on investments and new features for Foodie-Fi.

**Table 1: `plans`**

<img width="207" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/835c77b0-d670-473a-8c87-40b1873593d4">

Customers can choose which plans to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign up:

- Basic plan - customers have limited access and can only stream their videos and is only available monthly at $9.90.

- Pro plan - customers have no watch time limits and are able to download videos for offline viewing. Pro plans start at $19.90 a month or $199 for an annual subscription.

- Trial plan - customers can sign up to an initial 7 day free trial will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during the trial.

When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service - they will have a churn plan record with a null price but their plan will continue until the end of the billing period.

**Table 2: `subscriptions`**

<img width="240" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/197a70c6-fb10-41d4-9ef6-784091c00807">


Customer subscriptions show the **exact date** where their specific `plan_id` starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription ‚Äî the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over ‚Äî the `start_date` in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.

When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan ‚Äî the higher plan will take effect straightaway.

When customers churn, they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period, but the start_date will be technically the day they decided to cancel their service.

## Question and Solution

## üéûÔ∏è Part A: Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey.

```sql
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  p.plan_id,
  p.plan_name,
  s.start_date
FROM
  foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
  INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE
  customer_id IN (1, 2, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19);
```

After careful consideration, I have decided to focus on these three customers: 1, 13, and 15. By inspecting their records individually, we can begin to understand the customer journey through key data points. Let‚Äôs review these customers as examples

_(Refer to the table below)_

Customer 1 has joined the Foodie-Fi pro free trial on August 1st 2020 and subsequently downgraded to the basic monthly plan after 1 week on the 8th of August

<img width="560" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb9b1eda-b83b-4562-9784-f88a29747128">

Customer 13 has joined on 15th December 2020, downgraded to a basic plan right after the trial period until upgrading to a pro monthly plan on 29th of March

<img width="512" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1944db12-da27-46e2-82e9-d98e9b03f6ce">

Customer 15 has started their trial on 17th March - stayed on the pro monthly plan until they churned just after 1 month on 29th of April.

## Part B: Data Analysis Questions

### Q1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

Used `DISTINCT` then wrapped DISTINCT with `COUNT()`  to count the number of unique customers for Foodie-Fi.

```

- Foodie-Fi has 1,000 unique customers.
  
### Q2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

```sql

  DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date)::DATE AS month_start,
  COUNT(*) AS trial_customers
FROM
  foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE
  plan_id = 0
GROUP BY
  month_start
ORDER BY
